# InternetDownloadManager

This is a cross platform application developed in PyQT. This is a simple Internet Download Manager.
For using this application, you need PyQT4, sip and urllib modules. This was developed in python 3.4
and tested in Ubuntu 14.04

Download both codes from the riverbank website.
I downloaded the PyQt4_gpl_x11-4.12.1.tar.gz and sip-4.19.3.tar.gz

Install python3.4

cd Downloads/sip-4.19.3/
sudo /usr/bin/python3.4 configure.py
sudo make
sudo make install

cd PyQt4_gpl_x11-4.12.1/
sudo /usr/bin/python3.4 configure.py
sudo make
sudo make install

Open Pycharm and start coding.
